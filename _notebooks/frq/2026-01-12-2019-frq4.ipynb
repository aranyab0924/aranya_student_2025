    "Part A: initial grid creation\n",
    "- I created a 2D boolean array sized by the provided rows and columns.\n",
    "- A nested loop assigns each cell a true/false value with a 40% chance to start true (on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part B: evaluating a light\n",
    "- The requirement is to count how many lights are on in the same column as the target light (including the target).\n",
    "- If the target is on, it turns off when the column count is even; if odd it stays on.\n",
    "- If the target is off, it turns on only when the column count is a multiple of 3; otherwise it stays off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refined struggles and lessons:\n",
    "- The hardest part is carefully reading the FRQ wording: make sure the count is column-only and includes the target light. Double-check whether the rules apply to the original state or a synchronized next state; this implementation follows the FRQ’s local-evaluation interpretation (using the current board only).\n",
    "- Edge cases to consider: very small boards (1x1), and columns with all lights off or all on. I tested diagonal cells as a simple smoke test but recommend unit tests for more coverage.\n",
    "- When implementing similar problems, break the task down: (1) compute the metric (column count), (2) record the current state, (3) apply the rule deterministically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps: add a method to compute the full next board state (applying evaluateLight to every cell) and unit tests to validate against known examples."
